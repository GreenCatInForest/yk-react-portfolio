1. 7.11.23 - add conditional renders to project cards. 
> conditional render for projectCardTitle in ProjectCardContainer.js. Now the project card doesn't render if it has an empty title. 
> conditional render for projectBannerImg in ProjectCard.js. Card doesn't render empty space if projectBannerImg doesn't exist.
